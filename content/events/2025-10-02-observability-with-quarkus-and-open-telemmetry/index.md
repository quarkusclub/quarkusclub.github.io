  In this talk, we'll explore how Quarkus and OpenTelemetry complement each other to deliver modern, efficient, and extensible observability. We'll see in practice how to instrument applications, collect metrics, logs, and traces, and integrate with tools from the open source ecosystem. The goal is to demonstrate how to transform technical data into valuable insights, improving the developer experience and the reliability of production systems.

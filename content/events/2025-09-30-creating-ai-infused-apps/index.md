  Thanks to the ease of use and superb developer experience of Quarkus and the nice AI integration capabilities that the LangChain4j libraries offer, it becomes (almost) trivial to start working with Java and AI!
  In this session, you’ll explore how with a few lines of code, you can add a variety of AI capabilities: prompting, chaining, and preserving state; agents and function-calling; enriching your AI model’s knowledge with your own documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG); In addition, we'll add observability and fault tolerance to the AI integration.
  The party doesn't stop there though, because now everyone is talking about "Agentic AI". We'll show you how to get started with creating Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients AND servers.
  Come to this session to learn how to build AI-infused applications with Java and Quarkus.

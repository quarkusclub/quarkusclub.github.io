 Recently, in the Brazilian dev community, we had the "rinha de backend" (@rinhadebackend), a challenge where developers had to create and optimize a transactional API to support a high volume of transactions with minimal resources. As a Quarkus enthusiast, I could only imagine how far we could go.
 In this session, we will dive deeper into the solution and show how to build extremely lightweight containers using QuarkusIO, GraalVM, PostgreSQL and NGINX. We will explore the code, run load simulation with Gatling, share the results and much more. Join us and let's have fun extracting the maximum performance from the systems!

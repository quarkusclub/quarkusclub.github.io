 In this video, Matheus Cruz explains in detail how a Quarkus extension works and how you can create one. You'll learn what Quarkus is, what build time augmentation is, and how the extension works behind the scenes to generate its superatomic and supersonic bytecode. You'll also see how we can use BuildItems, Gizmo, and Jandex in a simple example of creating an extension.

 I hear you thinking, “is this yet another session about doing cloud native development?”. Well.. yes, sort of, but we promise it’s going to be a good one - or so we think :). In this session we’re going to talk (and demo!) about what it means to be a good Cloud Citizen - which is more than merely putting an application in a container and deploying it. To optimize your Java application's performance and resilience in the cloud, it is essential to consider factors such as providing real-time health status through fine-grained metrics. You’ll also need to ensure fast startup, and avoid excessive resource consumption within the cluster. Being a good Cloud Citizen also involves streamlining configuration, deployment and upgrade processes. By integrating these tasks seamlessly, the application can facilitate smooth deployments and upgrades, which will lead to more efficiency and ease of management.

 I hear you thinking, “is this yet another session about doing cloud native development?”. Well.. yes, sort of, but we promise it’s going to be a good one - or so we think :). In this session we’re going to talk (and demo!) about what it means to be a good Cloud Citizen - which is more than merely putting an application in a container and deploying it.

 In this presentation we will go through the conceptual part of what Clean Arch is and what its benefits are. To close with a keynote, we will carry out a hands-on application of clean architecture in practice in an API (user CRUD), performing persistence (by implementation) of data in both Postgres and MongoDB, thus presenting one of its main benefits, which is the high level of decoupling.

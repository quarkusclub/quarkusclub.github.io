 Are you a Spring developer and interested in learning something new? In this session I will show concepts and conventions familiar to Spring developers and how those same concepts and conventions can be implemented in Quarkus, all while highlighting similarities and differences between them, including how testing is done. Additionally, I will highlight performance characteristics between them and prove, live, that you could save 50% in your operational costs and reduce your carbon emissions 2-3x simply by switching your Java runtime.

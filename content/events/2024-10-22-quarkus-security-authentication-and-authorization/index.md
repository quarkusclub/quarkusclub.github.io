 In this session, Sergey will introduce you to Quarkus Security Architecture and explain how its authentication and authorization layers work, how they can be customized and how the security identity can be augmented. We will look at how JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are structured and can be easily generated in Quarkus. We will proceed by looking in detail at OpenId Connect support in Quarkus and run several demos which show Keycloak Dev service support,  how to work with Auth0 in devmode, and how to support more than one OAuth2 social provider authentication.

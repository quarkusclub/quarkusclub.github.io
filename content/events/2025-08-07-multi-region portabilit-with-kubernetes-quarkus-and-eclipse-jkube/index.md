  IDP is currently one of the largest delivery platforms in Central America. Originally created as a proof of concept, the software was a victim of its own success, needing to evolve from a clickops environment to a DR Warm Standby deployment.
  In this journey, you will learn the motivations and architectural principles of the past, which have become future advantages for architectural evolution. We will learn how the 12 factors of cloud native, microservices, and IaC, applied correctly (or not), facilitated the journey through Java and Cloud Native tools.

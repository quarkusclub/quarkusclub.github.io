description: "In this talk, you'll learn how the MCP (Model Context Protocol) protocol allows Java backends to communicate with language models like GPT in a practical and intelligent way. We'll explore fundamental concepts, create an MCP server and client in Java using Spring AI, and understand how this approach can transform your backend into an intelligent agent capable of executing business logic with natural language commands. Ideal for those who want to connect Java with the future of AI."
